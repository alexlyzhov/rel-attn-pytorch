This is a minimal implementation of ["Relational Attention: Generalizing Transformers for Graph-Structured Tasks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05062) in PyTorch that is close to the [original Jax class definitions](https://github.com/CameronDiao/relational-transformer/blob/master/clrs/_src/processors.py).
